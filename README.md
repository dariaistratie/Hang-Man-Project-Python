# Hang-Man-Project-Python
Hang Man Game in Python
A simple word-guessing game where the player must guess a hidden word letter by letter before running out of attempts. Built using Python, this project demonstrates basic logic, loops, and user input handling.

Features:
 Random word selection
 Letter-by-letter guessing
 Limited attempts with a hangman drawing
 Win or lose conditions

 Future improvements: GUI, difficulty levels, and a larger word database.








Used python in order to develop a simple hang man game, with 6 tries to complete the word.
